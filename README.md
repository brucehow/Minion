Minion is a Java based discord bot used for the University of Western Australia League Club (UWALC).

This bot requires a functional database (jdbc used here) and a class containing constant variables. These files have been omitted to the repo for obvious reasons.

## Events
### **Rift Champions**
Rift Champions is a weekly event run by UWALC. It involves several 10-man in-house games where club members can gather points for their participation and performance. This event was on every Fridays between 8PM to 11PM and occured over the course of Semester 1.

Users who join the Rift Champions lobby will be automatically drafted into even teams. To ensure that these games are fair and have a competitive feel, Minion uses the API method Summoner-V4 and League-V4 to obtain each summoner's rank, and a Matchmaking algorithm to draft the players.
